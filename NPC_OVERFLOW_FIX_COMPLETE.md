# NPC Card Overflow Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Identified
The NPC cards were not displaying all their content because the CSS had `overflow: hidden` set on the `.npc-card` class, which was cutting off content instead of allowing cards to expand to their full height.

## Root Cause
During the CSS refactoring process, `overflow: hidden` was added to the `.npc-card` class in `src/components/npc-card/npc-card.css`. This property was **NOT** present in the original working CSS (`css/styles.css`).

## The Fix
**Removed the problematic `overflow: hidden` property from `.npc-card`:**

### Before (Problematic):
```css
.npc-card {
  background-color: var(--card-bg);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius-md);
  padding: var(--spacing-lg);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px var(--shadow-color);
  transition: all var(--transition-normal);
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;  /* ❌ This was cutting off content */
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```css
.npc-card {
  background-color: var(--card-bg);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius-md);
  padding: var(--spacing-lg);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px var(--shadow-color);
  transition: all var(--transition-normal);
  cursor: pointer;
  position: relative;
  /* ✅ overflow: hidden removed - cards now expand to show all content */
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ NPC cards now expand to show all content
- ✅ Secrets, motivations, and abilities sections are fully visible
- ✅ No content is cut off or truncated
- ✅ Cards maintain responsive grid layout
- ✅ Matches original CSS behavior
- ✅ Other appropriate `overflow` settings remain intact (modals, accessibility, etc.)

## Files Modified
- `src/components/npc-card/npc-card.css` - Removed `overflow: hidden` from `.npc-card`

## Result
**NPC cards now display all their content properly without being cut off!** The cards expand to their natural height based on content, just like the original implementation.

This fix ensures that players can see all the important NPC information including secrets, motivations, and abilities without any content being hidden or truncated.
